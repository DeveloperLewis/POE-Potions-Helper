# POE Potions Helper
 A small script to help with pressing 1-5. Without getting carpal tunnel.

 Feel free to edit to your own liking. The slower the less likely you are to be banned. Which is extremely low, I have been using this script for many years. 

 Default pausing key is ` (Tilde). This is also changable.
 Default using key is SPACE. This too, is changeable.
